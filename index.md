# Welcome!

Welcome to Mr. Allatta's Learning Blog! This will be my home base for sharing learning reflections with my students through out the year. 

In 2018-2019 my students are 9th and 10th graders at the Academy for Software Engineering. They are the "Lower Academy" of a comprehensive public high school in NYC. The two year lower academy sequence is required of all students and culminates in the AP Computer Science Principles exam.

# Learning Reflections

Soon to be links to learning posts, which will contain reflections and anticipations of the lower academy courses.

# About Me

Soon to be an "About Me" section
